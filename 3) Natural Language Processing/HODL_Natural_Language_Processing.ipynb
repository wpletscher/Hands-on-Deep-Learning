Linguists and NLP researchers usually refer to such a dataset as a \"text corpus\" (plural: text corpora). There are a lot of datasets to choose from. For our introductory examples, we will look at the Brown corpus. It consists of one million words of American English texts printed in 1961 that linguists revised at Brown University.

Training works in an unsupervised fashion, meaning that we don't need any labels and can just pass our text corpus to Word2Vec for training. The output is a simple mapping from words that are contained in the corpus to its vector embedding, where every entry of the vectors is in [-1, 1].

This approach follows the distributional hypothesis about language formulated by Harris in 1954:\n",

This enables us to represent every token with an element from a fixed size set of vectors that we can pass to the model (we also need these vectors to be of fixed size, because our neural networks can only deal with fixed-size inputs). For example, we can build a list of all words in the vocabulary and use the index of a word in this list to identify it. Also, because a language model can not infer much information from an identifier it has never seen during training, the vocabulary size must stay fixed. At the same time, we want to feed arbitrary words to the language model after it has been trained. But how can we encode arbitrary words with a vocabulary that has a fixed size?

    "So let's say we are given some text corpus and want to generate new sentences that are very \"alike\" what we saw in the corpus. There are multiple ways to do this. A straightforward approach is based on conditional probabilities. In this case, we generate the new text word by word (this approach is also called \"autoregressive\") and always base our choice for the next word on what we already generated. So every time we add a new word, we ask ourselves the question: What word is most likely to appear next regarding what we already have? And this is exactly where conditional probabilities come in. We start with a simplified variant, the 2-gram.\n",

    "For 2-grams, we base our decision solely on the last word we previously generated (instead of the complete, already generated text). To compute probabilities for the following most likely word, we can then use simple statistic properties of our text corpus: For every word in the corpus, we count the words that follow it and how often. This gives us an estimate for what word most likely appears afterward.\n",
    "\n",

    "The input sequence is denoted as $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{\\tau}$. The gray block containing the functions $\\hat{g}$ and $\\hat{h}$ is a neural network that takes two things as input:\n",

    "1.   An element $x_t$ of the sequence\n",
    "2.   A state $s_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this input, it outputs a prediction $y_t$. We apply this block to every element of the sequence in order. The state $s_t$ is used to encode all necessary information of the input $x_0, \\dots, x_{t-1}$ when we make the prediction for $x_t$. In the beginning, we initialize the state $s_0$ by setting it to all zeros. This state is then passed to the network, together with $x_0$. We then get the prediction $y_0$ and the state $s_1$ that is used for the subsequent evaluation of the same network for the next element in the input sequence $x_1$. This is what we see on the right of the image. Note that all gray blocks are the same network. We just run it again and again (recurrently). The length of the sequence can therefore be arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to implement the gray block. We will use Long short-term memory (LSTM) units in the upcoming task. Similar in concept to n-grams, we predict the next word in the sequence based on what we saw before. These predictions are exactly the $y_i$. More precisely, our prediction is a probability distribution over the whole vocabulary, telling us which words are the most likely to follow.   \n",
    "We work with the brown corpus again, so let's make sure it's ready. Training on the whole corpus would take too long for this tutorial, so we restrict ourselves to the first 200,000 words."

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",

Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn\\'t match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a \\'sci-fi\\' setting. (I\\'m sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It\\'s not. It\\'s clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It\\'s really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it\\'s rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry\\'s Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry\\'s ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space.

    "Until now, we created our own models using some building blocks from pytorch like the the LSTM module. The RNN was already capable of getting some decent predictions. Nowadays, another architecture is predominantly used for almost all NLP tasks. It is called \"Transformer\" and the main difference to RNNs is that instead of sequentially processing the input sequence, it uses an \"attention\" mechanism to process all elements in the sequence at once. Every element can \"attend\" to every other element, meaning it knows approximately where it is located in the sequence and what other elements are. We omit further details here. There are a lot of good tutorials online that you can check out to get a more profound introduction to how transformers work under the hood. For us, they are just a building block (or black box) that we can use to get predictions. We already talked about one transformer: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)."

I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.\n",

      " Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good.

    "Modern generative language models use a decoder-only transformer architectures to produce text by computing a probability distribution over a large vocabulary given a context. Some popular model families include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT Series (OpenAI):**  *GPT-2* is fully open source, while later versions are more restricted.\n",
    "- **Llama (Meta):**  Fully open source, with multiple model sizes.\n",
    "- **Gemini (Google DeepMind):** A powerful but closed-source model.\n",
    "- **Qwen (Alibaba):** Offers models in various sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source families typically offer several sizes and both base and instruct versions. Most of them can be downloaded using the [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co)'s `transformers` library. The base version is trained on a vast text corpus to predict the next token, while the instruct version is further fine-tuned to follow human instructions, making it better suited for tasks like question answering, code generation, summarization, and more. This fine-tuning step is commonly known as _alignment_.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step during text generation, the model outputs a probability distribution over its vocabulary (of tokens). To generate text, one must sample from this distribution using different methods. Some of the most popular are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greedy Decoding:**  \n",
    "  Always picks the token with the highest probability.\n",
    "- **Top‑k Sampling:**  \n",
    "  Samples from the top _k_ tokens, adding randomness while limiting the choice set.\n",
    "- **Nucleus (Top‑p) Sampling:**  \n",
    "  Samples from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds _p_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with these sampling methods helps control the creativity and diversity of the generated text. We will explore and visualize how these probability distributions look like for `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`, a lightweight (0.5 billion parameters) model, which fits comfortably within our limited GPU memory. Its compact size ensures efficient inference and fast experimentation while still providing strong performance for instructional tasks."
